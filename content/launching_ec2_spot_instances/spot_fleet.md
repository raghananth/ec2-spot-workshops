## Launching EC2 Spot Instances via a Spot Fleet request

You can create a Spot Fleet request and specify a launch template in the
instance configuration. When Amazon EC2 fulfills the Spot Fleet request,
it uses the launch parameters defined in the associated launch template.

**To create a Spot Fleet request using the recommended settings**

1. Open the Spot console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2spot>.

1. If you are new to Spot, you see a welcome page; choose **Get started**. 
Otherwise, choose **Request Spot Instances**.

1. For **Tell us your application or task need**, choose **Flexible workloads**.

1. Under **Configure your instances:**
    - For **Launch template**, select the Launch template you created earlier.
    - Leave the **Minimum compute** unit values as default.
    - For **Network**, select the VPC in which the subnet used in the launch template belongs.
    - Under **Availability Zone**, check all of the availability zones that have an available subnet.

1. Under **Tell us how much capacity you need**, for **Total target capacity**, 
specify **6 vCPUs**, and for **Optional On-Demand
    portion**, specify **2 vCPUs**.

1. Check the box for **Maintain target capacity**. Leave the **Interruption behavior** as **Terminate**.

1. Review the recommended **Fleet request settings** based on your application or task selection, 
and choose **Launch**.

The request type is fleet. When the request is fulfilled, requests of
type instance are added, where the state is active and the status
is fulfilled.
